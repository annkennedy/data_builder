# data_builder
This is data_builder code from [Bento](http://www.github.com/annkennedy/Bento), split into its own repository so it can be used more broadly with other projects. Bento's own version of data_builder is still in place for now, but will eventually be replaced with a link to this version.

## How it works
The goal of data_builder is to allow experimentalists to link together multiple files associated with an experiment, and load those files into a common structure in Matlab. Data in this structure can then be analyzed using various functions (eg in [the VMHvl imaging repository](http://www.github.com/djalab/VMHvl_imaging)) or visualized using [Bento](http://www.github.com/annkennedy/Bento).
